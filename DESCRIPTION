Description: Provides tools to compare decision tables and operating
    characteristics for phase I dose-finding trial designs, including the
    traditional 3+3 design, the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design
    (Liu and Yuan (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12089>), the modified Toxicity
    Probability Interval-2 (mTPI-2) design, the interval 3+3 (i3+3) design,
    and the Generalized 3+3 (G3) design. Functions are provided to generate
    decision tables and operating characteristic plots for objective comparison
    of these methods.
