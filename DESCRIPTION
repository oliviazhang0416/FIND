Description: Generate decision tables and simulate operating characteristics
    for phase I dose-finding designs to enable objective comparison across
    methods. Supported designs include the traditional 3+3, Bayesian Optimal
    Interval (BOIN), modified Toxicity Probability Interval-2 (mTPI-2),
    interval 3+3 (i3+3), and Generalized 3+3 (G3). Provides visualization
    tools for comparing decision rules and operating characteristics across
    multiple designs simultaneously.
