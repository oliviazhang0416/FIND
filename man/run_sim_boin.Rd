\arguments{
\item{p.true}{a vector or matrix containing the true toxicity probabilities of the investigational dose levels.}

\item{mtd.true}{a numeric value or a vector which specifies the true MTD.}

\item{pT}{a numeric value; the target DLT rate.}

\item{EI}{a vector which specifies the equivalence interval (EI).}

\item{ncohort}{a numeric value; the total number of cohorts.}

\item{cohortsize}{a numeric value; the cohort size.}

\item{startdose}{a numeric value; the starting dose level for the trial.}

\item{DU.pp}{a numeric value; the cutoff to remove an overly toxic dose for safety.
We recommend the default value of (\code{DU.pp=0.95}) for general use.}

\item{n.earlystop}{a numeric value; the early stopping parameter. If the number of participants
treated at the current dose reaches \code{n.earlystop},
stop the trial and select the MTD based on the observed data.
The default value \code{n.earlystop=100} essentially turns
off this type of early stopping.}

\item{extrasafe}{a logical value which specifies whether to implement a more strict safety rule (see more in the Details).}

\item{ntrial}{a numeric value; the total number of simulated trials.}

\item{seed}{a numeric value; the random seed for simulation.}

\details{
Denote the current dose \eqn{d}. Let \eqn{n_d} and \eqn{y_d} represent the
          number of participants treated at dose \eqn{d} and the number of participants
          experienced DLT, respectively. Let \eqn{p_d} be the toxicity probability at
          dose \eqn{d}. Also, denote \eqn{\frac{y_d}{n_d}} the observed toxicity rate
          at the current dose.

          The BOIN design uses the following decision rules: if
          \eqn{\frac{y_d}{n_d}} is lower than or equal to the escalation boundary,
          the decision is to escalate to the next higher dose; if \eqn{\frac{y_d}{n_d}}
          is higher than the de-escalation boundary, the decision is to the next lower
          dose; otherwise, the decision is to stay at the current dose.

          Also, the BOIN design includes a dose exclusion rule. Let \eqn{p_T} represents
          the pT DLT rate. If \eqn{Pr(p_d > p_T | y_d , n_d ) > 0.95}, dose \eqn{d}
          and those higher than \eqn{d} are removed from the trial since they are deemed
          excessively toxic.

          The BOIN design has two early stopping rules: (1) stop the trial if the lowest
         dose is eliminated due to toxicity, and no dose should be selected as the MTD; and
         (2) stop the trial and select the MTD if the number of participants treated at the current
         dose reaches \code{n.earlystop}.

         For some applications, investigators may prefer a more strict safety rule for MTD selection
         (This can be achieved by setting \code{extrasafe} == T). If the isotonically-transformed
         posterior mean of the selected MTD is above the EI, select the next lower dose as the final MTD.
